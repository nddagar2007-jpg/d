										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kevin had a lot going on in his life and was trying to find the right educational environment to fit into his needs and schedule. There weren’t many opportunities around him outside of the local community college and he was stuck just trying to find a way to learn. Dive into his journey to find out how edX helped him get back into learning and earn credits towards his bachelor’s degree.</p>
<blockquote><p>People who build their own home tend to be very courageous. These people are curious about life. They&#8217;re thinking about what it means to live in a house, rather than just buying a commodity.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>How He Did It</strong><br />
Kevin attended community college on and off after graduating from high school. He started for a year, paused to pursue other goals, and then resumed classes on and off for the next seven years before he found edX.</p>
<p>Kevin had heard about online courses before and knew they were very powerful learning environments where you could learn in an effective and efficient way. He decided to give edX a try when he saw a course that piqued his curiosity because of his interest in economics and international affairs: the macroeconomics of resource-rich countries. Kevin successfully passed the course and found it liberating to gain new knowledge and earn a verified certificate. He still uses a lot of the knowledge he built in that course on a daily basis when he’s observing the market and making political and economic observations for his politics blog.</p>
<p>Along with taking individual courses, Kevin enrolled in the Marketing Essentials MicroBachelors® program from DoaneX. He knew about different aspects of marketing from running a blog and managing social media, but this program helped him understand marketing as a whole and learn how to put everything together in one neat package. He was also able to add three more credits to his transcript because MicroBachelors programs offer real college credit. In the future, Kevin plans to continue to work towards his goals of finishing his bachelor’s degree, getting a job in finance, and starting a hedge fund.</p>
